## **Introduction**




TimeBuddy app aims to help students better  manage their time and tasks, by planning future events and providing notifications as a reminder of projects to be completed, in order to improve their overall results .
Study and course load organization are critical components of effective time management, described as a set of  behavioral  abilities. Empirical evidence shows that students who learn to deal with conflicting demands and manage their time well do better academically (Adams & Blair, 2019). All students interviewed in the prototyping stage admitted that they need better time management skills and showed interest in evaluating the app once this would be developed .
The app created in React is dedicated for mobile phone usage in order to be at hand at any time so the students can make full usage of it while providing the necessary features for planning and managing time in a smart and efficient way.









## **Methodology**



The methodology used for this project is Design Thinking Methodology because it provides a solution based approach that allows the developer to understand the user’s needs and in this way complete the first phase Empathize.
 
The first stages of the methodology have been covered in the first part of this assignment while the second part focuses on implementation and testing and at the same time revising the previous stages.



## **Methods**



The methods used to evaluate the proposed solution where one-to-one observation and interview session where the participants were observed interacting with the app and at the end an interview consisting in a set of six questions and a discussion about the overall performance of the prototype.
The same ten students that were involved in the prototyping phase were asked to take part in the evaluation but only seven attended the one-to-one sessions.

The evaluation of the prototype suggests that the proposed solution is highly likely to solve the time management problem, although a more  in depth study would be recommended in order to define new features and improve the existing ones.





## **Results**



The results of one-to-one session proved that TimeBuddy app has the potential to solve the addressed problem ,although further improvements are recommended. The app is partitioned into three different sections: “Tasks Today,” “Tasks Doing and Tasks Done,” and “The Calendar.” The decision to develop this app in this design was to ensure that the users could see the responsibilities they had to complete in terms of events and tasks at a glance. In the “Tasks Today,” the user can retrieve all the scheduled events for that day and the time they are to be carried out. Here, the user can identify when each event begins and when it ends. For example, the user can see what time they need to submit an assignment and when to feed a cat or go to the gym. As a result, it enables them to balance time between completing academic tasks and social events.
The “Tasks Doing” displays the ongoing group events, such as group assignments and planning of a birthday party. In this interface, the app displays the event’s title with an attachment section where the users can upload their files. The comment section allows the users to communicate with each other and edit the details of the event. It also notifies the user of the pending messages to be read. There is also a section that displays the duration of the event and the due date depending on what the users have decided and added to the event.
The “Tasks Done” shows the user the completed events and are awaiting approval. For example, it reminds users that they need to submit completed but pending assignments to ensure that their grades are not affected. It also reminds them of the time these events need to be completed. Upon completion, a delete button allows the user to erase the event from the app.
The app also contains a “Calendar” section that ensures users plan their events on time. The calendar displays the information about the task and its date. This section is meant to provide the user with more information regarding each task and ensure they can see each task.
Although the TimeBuddy app has received good feedback, the scope of the project is not fully achieved ,therefore  improvements  like file attachments and work chats have been discussed during the prototype evaluation, but due to limited timeframe these features have not been implemented.





## **Conclusion**



The project seeks to help students that struggle managing their time and workload as well as their social live by offering a easy way to plan and prioritise activities, set goals and tasks and most importantly reminding them when each task is due and therefor, it has a good chance to become a suitable solution to solve the time management problem among the university students, if a more in dept study is conducted and further improvements implemented.
